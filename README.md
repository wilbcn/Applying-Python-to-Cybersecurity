# Applying-Python-to-Cybersecurity

1. password_strength_check.py -
This project was one of my first projects using Python for cybersecurity. Here I wrote a simple function that takes user input and provides feedback on the strength of the password.

2. python-passgen.py
This project was a follow up project to my password strength checker. Here I wrote a more complex script that takes user input, to return a password based on the users preferred parameters, much like a real password generator tool where you can customise the length and what will be included.
