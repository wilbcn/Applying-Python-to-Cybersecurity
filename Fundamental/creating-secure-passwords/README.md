# Creating Secure passwords using Python

In this folder I have created some programmes in Python to generate strong passwords in a hypothetical scenario. These programmes helped me to develop my understanding of Python, exploring cybersecurity concepts, and a way to document my personal growth and learning journey.

1. password_strength_check.py -
This project was one of my first projects using Python for cybersecurity. Here I wrote a simple function that takes user input and provides feedback on the strength of the password.

2. python-passgen.py
This project was a follow up project to my password strength checker. Here I wrote a more complex script that takes user input, to return a password based on the users preferred parameters, much like a real password generator tool where you can customise the desired output.
