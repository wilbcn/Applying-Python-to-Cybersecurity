# Applying-Python-to-Cybersecurity

The projects in this directory were created to gain hands-on experience with Python, applying it to real-world scenarios in the field of cybersecurity. These projects explore various cybersecurity concepts, including those related to cloud environments, while documenting my personal growth and learning journey.

I have a keen interest in AWS and have undertaken projects focusing on AWS services. This work aims to deepen my understanding of cloud computing and security, particularly in securing AWS environments. These projects include automating security checks, analyzing IAM policies, ensuring S3 compliance, and addressing EC2 vulnerabilities.

Through these efforts, I am developing a strong foundation in:

- Python Programming: Writing efficient and reusable code for automation and security analysis.
- AWS Services: Gaining practical knowledge of IAM, S3, EC2, and other AWS components.
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Identifying and mitigating security risks, with a focus on cloud security.

This repository serves as a reflection of my ongoing commitment to combining programming expertise with cybersecurity practices to tackle modern challenges in securing cloud environments.
